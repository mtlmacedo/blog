Hey there !

I'm a Software engineer with over 5 years of experience specializing in .NET development. Proficient in technologies such as C/C++, .NET, Python, java, SQL, Angular, Azure, REST API, and Typescript.

I have a strong foundation in building complex software systems. I am currently seeking to transition to Go(lang) development.
